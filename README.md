# Game Engine
## + UNO game as example

This is a library to build game servers fast.
It includes packages for event streaming, a socket implementation and a rpc server.

## What's in here?
Basically the idea is, that you only need to build the domain logic of the game you need and connect it to either a socket, or websocket. The streaming is done with sockets or websockets aswell.

## Demo: UNO
As an example I have built the domain for the UNO card game.
